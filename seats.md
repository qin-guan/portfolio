# Seats

As a student, I find that I'm always searching around the country for places to sit down and do work, or use my laptop.

Why spend money at Starbucks for an average drink when you can get bubble tea and chill at a place that's free?

Anyways, here's a compilation of some of them =)

## Fairmont, Raffles City

Located on the floor above the main Raffles City mall, there are plenty of chairs and tables here to do work on. May be crowded during events.

Access this hidden place through the escalators at G2000!

## Funan staircases

Your average staircase with chargers, may be crowded during weekends.

## SMU Underground Tunnels

Open to the public and hidden in the undergrounds of the city area.

Please give up your seats if you see students! But otherwise great place to study at during the weekends!
