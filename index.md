## :school: My education

### Ngee Ann Polytechnic <Badge type="tip" text="2021 - Current" />

I am currently pursuing a diploma in Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, together with the Certificate in Advanced Computing Mathematics at Ngee Ann Polytechnic.

### School of Science and Technology, Singapore <Badge type="default" text="2017 - 2020" />

At the School of Science and Technology, we are able to choose an O-Level Applied Subject to develop our interests in a specific field. For myself, I chose Computing+ as my Applied Subject, which allows me to develop my computational thinking skills, and also further my knowledge in the Python language.

### Swift Accelerator Program <Badge type="default" text="2018" />

I am part of the pioneering batch of the Swift Accelerator Program. The 9 months long program, by IMDA and Apple, covers skills such as building apps with Swift and also marketing and design principles.

The Swift Innovators Summit is a summit held at the end of the Swift Accelerator Program for students to showcase their apps. My schoolmate, Carl, and I created an app, Parkgoer, and presented it at the Summit to IMDA Assistant Chief Executive of Planning, Ms Koh Li-Na. Parkgoer is an app to help children find parks and recreational facilities around Singapore.

### Co-Founded CodeCollab.io <Badge type="default" text="2018-2023" />

Together with my schoolmate, Carl, we created CodeCollab, a collaborative code editor that allows anyone to compile, collaborate and create code anywhere, at any time.

### Software Engineer Intern at PigeonLab <Badge type="default" text="2021" />

In 2021, I joined the PigeonLab team, which created [Pigeonhole Live](https://pigeonholelive.com), a live audience engagement platform, as a Software Engineer Intern. At PigeonLab, I worked on our internal tooling with frameworks like VueJS and ExpressJS. I also gained experience working with AWS services such as S3.
