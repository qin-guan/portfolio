A survey platform for World Skills ASEAN (Singapore 2023).

With my amazing decision making skills, I decided to create this platform 1 week before the event because why not. The platform allows event organizers to create surveys, and view responses with a little bit of analytics.

For admins (me!), there's also a lucky draw thingy.

Across 3 days, the platform collected around 2000 responses.
