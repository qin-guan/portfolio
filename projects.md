A platform for you to make your own digital namecards, and share them.

Was a good place for me to play with Cloudflare KV and Next.JS 13's App Router + RSC capabilities.

[GitHub](https://github.com/qin-guan/wsa-tollbooth) | [Website](https://wsa.qinguan.me)

A survey platform for World Skills ASEAN (Singapore 2023).

With my amazing decision making skills, I decided to create this platform 1 week before the event because why not. The platform allows event organizers to create surveys, and view responses with a little bit of analytics.

For admins (me!), there's also a lucky draw thingy.

Across 3 days, the platform collected around 2000 responses.
