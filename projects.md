## `Homer`

[GitHub](https://github.com/qin-guan/Homer)

Jarvis of the house, but dumber. Tries to be helpful but sometimes isn't. Powered by Home Assistant, NetDaemon and New Relic. Runs a bunch of automations around the house (like controlling my toilet light, very helpful) and pipes some statistics to New Relic so I can make fancy dashboards.

Started after I got fed up with writing YAML Home Assistant automations.

Homer processes millions of events a month for me and makes it useful.

First time using ReactiveX (Rx.NET) and learned a lot.

[GitHub](https://github.com/qin-guan/wsa-tollbooth) | [Website](https://wsa.qinguan.me)

A survey platform for World Skills ASEAN (Singapore 2023).

With my amazing decision making skills, I decided to create this platform 1 week before the event because why not. The platform allows event organizers to create surveys, and view responses with a little bit of analytics.

For admins (me!), there's also a lucky draw thingy.

Across 3 days, the platform collected around 2000 responses.
